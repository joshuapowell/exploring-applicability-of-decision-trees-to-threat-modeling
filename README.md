# Exploring the Applicability of Decision Trees to Automated Threat Modeling
Exploring the basics of decision trees and their applicability to automate threat modeling in the development and deployment of REST APIs.

# Reproducing the Experiments
The experiments are available in the included code notebook title `exploratory-decisions-trees.ipynb`.

The experiments require that the packages listed in `requirements.txt` be installed prior to executing any code from within the notebook.

It is recommended that you isolate these experiments and their requirements by installing the dependent Python packages within a virtual environment.

The experiments and the required Python package dependencies were originally tested using `pyenv`.
